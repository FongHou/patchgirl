## Features


📢 Scenario of tests

Play multiple requests one after another. This is useful if you want to:
- Automate your development environment db (eg: create many users,...)
- Automate the test of your API (eg: create a user then show it then delete it)

📜 pre-request script

Run a javascript script right before a request is executed. This is useful if you want to:
 - Include timestamp in the request headers
 - Send a random string in the URL parameters

📜 post-request script

Run a javascript script after a request is executed. This is useful if you want to:
 - Assert for a response status or body
 - Set variables according on the response body

📦 Desktop app

Install a desktop app (Only Linux at the moment) so you can use PatchGirl locally. This is useful if you want to:
- Use PatchGirl without internet access
- Call localhost url (This would also solve browser CORS restriction)
- Have faster request execution (no round trip to a remote server, everything is done on your computer)
