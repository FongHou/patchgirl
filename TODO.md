# TODO

## Back

- use http method/scheme from library
- migrate to nix
- update ghc version to 8.8 so I can use https://github.com/ocharles/weeder#readme and remove dead code

## Front

- http response header and body in tabs instead of in the same view
- http large body response on chrome: force to use keyboard to view everything
- environment to run selection: when selected, going to the env tab should focus on the environment selected
- http builder - when no header input don't show the header label
- when navigating through the main menu, we shouldn't reset the current focus builder, eg: after going from `req/:uuid` to `env/`, when I click on the `Request` Menu, I need to go back to `req/uuid`
- long json response body won't show scrollbars in the input so we have to scroll with the keyboard

## OS
